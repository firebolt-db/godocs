# DROP LOCATION

Removes a location object from your Firebolt account. Be cautious when dropping a location that is referenced by external tables, as it may impact dependent objects.

**Topics:**

* [Parameters](#parameters)
* [Examples](#examples)
* [Error handling](#error-handling)
* [Best practices](#best-practices)
* [Notes](#notes)

## Syntax

```sql
DROP LOCATION [IF EXISTS] <location_name> [WITH FORCE]
```

## Parameters 


| Parameter | Description |
| :-------- | :---------- |
| `<location_name>` | The identifier of the location to remove. |
| `IF EXISTS` | A parameter that suppresses the error if the location doesn't exist. |
| `WITH FORCE` | Forces the removal of the location even if it has dependent external tables. **Warning**: This option invalidates all dependent external tables. |

## Examples

**Drop a location**

The following code example removes a `LOCATION` object from your Firebolt account:

```sql
DROP LOCATION my_location
```

**Drop IF EXISTS**

The following code example removes a `LOCATION` object from your Firebolt account if it exists:

```sql
DROP LOCATION IF EXISTS my_location
```

**Drop with FORCE Option**

If you attempt to drop a location that is referenced by an external table, the drop operation fails by default. You can do either of the following:

1. **Safe Approach**: Drop all dependent external tables before dropping the location.
2. **Force Approach**: Use the `WITH FORCE` option to drop the location immediately regardless of dependencies.

If you choose `WITH FORCE`, the following apply:
* The location is deleted regardless of existing dependencies.
* All external tables that reference the removed location become invalid.
* Queries on any invalid tables will result in an error.
* You must manually clean up the invalid external tables after using `WITH FORCE`.

The following code example deletes a `LOCATION` object from your Firebolt account without considering its dependencies:

```sql
DROP LOCATION my_location WITH FORCE
```

## Error handling

The following table lists the types of errors that may occur during location removal:

| Error Type                    | Cause                                                        | Resolution                                                      |
|:------------------------------ |:------------------------------------------------------------ |:--------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Location Not Found or Unauthorized** | The specified location does not exist or you lack permission to access it. | Use `IF EXISTS` to handle non-existent locations without error.  |
| **Dependent Objects Exist**    | The location is referenced by one or more external tables.   | Drop the dependent tables first or use `WITH FORCE` to bypass dependency checks. |
| **Invalid External Table**     | Attempting to query an external table after its location was removed using `WITH FORCE`. | Drop the invalid external table.                                |


## Best Practices

When dropping a location, consider the following:

1. **Before Dropping**
   - Use `IF EXISTS` to handle non-existent locations gracefully.
   - Ensure no active queries are using the location.
   - Check for dependent external tables. 

To identify external tables that depend on this location, execute the following query.
```sql
SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables WHERE location_name = 'my_location_name'
```

2. **Using WITH FORCE**
   - Use only when necessary.
   - Clean up invalid external tables immediately.
   - Document the reason for using this option.

3. **After Dropping**
   - Verify all dependent objects are handled.
   - Update any scripts or documentation referencing the location.
