# ALTER USER

Updates the configuration of the specified user.

For more information, see [Managing users](../../../Guides/managing-your-organization/managing-users.md).

## ALTER USER SET

### Syntax

```sql
ALTER USER <user_name> SET
	[ LOGIN = <login_name> | DEFAULT ]
        [ SERVICE_ACCOUNT = <service_account_name> | DEFAULT ]
        [ DEFAULT_DATABASE = <database_name> | DEFAULT ]
	[ DEFAULT_ENGINE = <engine_name> | DEFAULT ];
```

{: .no_toc} 

| Parameter | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `<user_name>`                              | The name of the user, may contain non-alpha-numeric characters such as exclamation points (!), percent signs (%), dots (.), underscores (_), dashes (-), and asterisks (*).
