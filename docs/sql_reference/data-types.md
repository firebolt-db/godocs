{:.no_toc}

This topic lists the data types available in Firebolt.

* Topic ToC
{:toc}


## Numeric

### INTEGER
A whole number ranging from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. `INTEGER` data types require 4 bytes of storage.
Synonyms: `INT`, `INT4`.

### BIGINT
A whole number ranging from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807. `BIGINT` data types require 8 bytes of storage.
Synonyms: `LONG`, `INT8`.

### NUMERIC
An exact numeric data type defined by its precision (total number of digits) and scale (number of digits to the right of the decimal point). For more information, see [NUMERIC data type](numeric-data-type.md). 
Synonyms: `DECIMAL`.

### REAL
A floating-point number that has six decimal-digit precision. Decimal (fixed point) types are not supported. `REAL` data types require 4 bytes of storage.
Synonyms: `FLOAT4`.

### DOUBLE PRECISION
A floating-point number that has 15 decimal-digit precision. Decimal (fixed point) types are not supported. `DOUBLE` data types require 8 bytes.
Synonyms: `DOUBLE`, `FLOAT`, `FLOAT8`, `FLOAT(p)` where 25 <= p <= 53.

## String

### TEXT
A string of an arbitrary length that can contain any number of bytes. Useful for arbitrary-length string columns. Note that null bytes are not supported in TEXT literals, but are supported when importing from an external table. Firebolt supports UTF-8 escape sequences.
Synonyms: `STRING`, `VARCHAR`

## Date and timestamp

{: .warning}
  >You are looking at the documentation for Firebolt's redesigned date and timestamp types.
  >These types were introduced in DB version 3.19 under the names `PGDATE`, `TIMESTAMPNTZ` and `TIMESTAMPTZ`, and synonyms `DATE`, `TIMESTAMP` and `TIMESTAMPTZ` made available in DB version 3.22.
  >
  >Determine which types you are using by executing the query `SELECT EXTRACT(CENTURY FROM DATE '2023-03-16');`.
  >If this query returns a result, you are using the redesigned date and timestamp types and can continue with this documentation.
  >If this query returns an error, you are using the legacy date and timestamp types and can find [legacy documentation here](legacy-date-timestamp.md), or instructions to reingest your data to use the new types [here](../release-notes/release-notes-archive.html#db-version-322).

Firebolt supports three date and timestamp data types:

| Name          | Size    | Minimum                          | Maximum                          | Resolution    |
| :------------ | :------ | :------------------------------- | :------------------------------- | :------------ |
| `DATE`        | 4 bytes | `0001-01-01`                     | `9999-12-31`                     | 1 day         |
| `TIMESTAMP`   | 8 bytes | `0001-01-01 00:00:00.000000`     | `9999-12-31 23:59:59.999999`     | 1 microsecond |
| `TIMESTAMPTZ` | 8 bytes | `0001-01-01 00:00:00.000000 UTC` | `9999-12-31 23:59:59.999999 UTC` | 1 microsecond |

Dates are counted according to the [proleptic Gregorian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proleptic_Gregorian_calendar).
Each year consists of 365 days, with leap days added to February in leap years.

### DATE

A year, month, and day calendar date independent of a time zone. For more information, see [DATE data type](date-data-type.md).

### TIMESTAMP

A year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and microsecond timestamp independent of a time zone. For more information, see [TIMESTAMP data type](timestampntz-data-type.md).

### TIMESTAMPTZ

A year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and microsecond timestamp associated with a time zone. For more information, see [TIMESTAMPTZ data type](timestamptz-data-type.md).

## Boolean

### BOOLEAN
Represents boolean value of `TRUE` or `FALSE`.
Synonyms: `BOOL`

## Composite

### ARRAY
Represents an array of values. All elements of the array must have same data type. Elements of the array can be of any supported data type including nested arrays (array with arrays).

Array columns must be defined with the data type of the array elements, and optionally whether or not those elements are nullable. The following syntax options are supported: 

* `ARRAY(<data-type> [NULL | NOT NULL])`
* `<data-type> ARRAY`
* `<data-type>[]`

For example, the following three queries will create tables with the same nullable `demo_array` column of `TEXT` elements: 

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE demo1 (
  demo_array ARRAY(TEXT NULL) 
  );
  
  CREATE TABLE demo2 (
  demo_array TEXT[]
  );

  CREATE TABLE demo3 (
  demo_array TEXT ARRAY 
  );
  ```

  You can also specify that an array be NOT NULL, but you must then use the `ARRAY(<data-type> NOT NULL)` syntax.

#### Example
{: .no_toc}

The following `CREATE TABLE` statement shows arrays of different element types and different nullabilities.
```sql
CREATE TABLE demo (
  a_t ARRAY(TEXT NULL) NULL,
  a_i ARRAY(INTEGER NULL) NOT NULL,
  a_d ARRAY(DATE NOT NULL) NULL,
  a_f ARRAY(REAL NOT NULL) NOT NULL,
  a_a ARRAY(ARRAY(INTEGER NULL) NULL) NULL
);
```
And the following `INSERT INTO` statement demonstrates examples of values for these arrays:

```sql
INSERT INTO demo VALUES
  (
    ['Hello', NULL, 'world'],
    [1, 42, NULL],
    [DATE '2000-01-01'],
    [3.14, 2.71, 9.8],
    [ [1, 2], [NULL], NULL]
  ),
  (
    NULL,
    [],
    NULL,
    [],
    NULL
  )
```

## Date and timestamp

Firebolt supports three date and timestamp data types:

| Name          | Size    | Minimum                          | Maximum                          | Resolution    |
| :------------ | :------ | :------------------------------- | :------------------------------- | :------------ |
| `DATE`        | 4 bytes | `0001-01-01`                     | `9999-12-31`                     | 1 day         |
| `TIMESTAMP`   | 8 bytes | `0001-01-01 00:00:00.000000`     | `9999-12-31 23:59:59.999999`     | 1 microsecond |
| `TIMESTAMPTZ` | 8 bytes | `0001-01-01 00:00:00.000000 UTC` | `9999-12-31 23:59:59.999999 UTC` | 1 microsecond |

Dates are counted according to the [proleptic Gregorian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proleptic_Gregorian_calendar).
Each year consists of 365 days, with leap days added to February in leap years.

### DATE

A year, month, and day calendar date independent of a time zone. For more information, see [DATE data type](date-data-type.md).

### TIMESTAMP

A year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and microsecond timestamp independent of a time zone. For more information, see [TIMESTAMP data type](timestampntz-data-type.md).

### TIMESTAMPTZ

A year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and microsecond timestamp associated with a time zone. For more information, see [TIMESTAMPTZ data type](timestamptz-data-type.md).

## String

### TEXT

The `TEXT` type can be used to store character strings of any length using the UTF-8 encoding standard.
Only the ASCII letters "A" through "Z" and "a" through "z" are classified as letters (e.g., `UPPER('aäuü')` returns `'AäUü'`).
The sort order of two strings is determined using the collation `ucs_basic`, which sorts strings by Unicode code point (e.g., `'Ab' < 'ab'` is true as `A` (`U+0041`) is less than `a` (`U+0061`)).
The character with code zero cannot be in a string.

Regular string literals are enclosed in single quotes and don't recognize escape sequences.
Write two adjacent single quotes to include a single-quote character within a string literal (e.g., `'Leonard''s bicycle'`).

Escape string literals are specified by writing the letter `E` (upper or lower case) before the opening single quote, e.g., `E'Firebolt 🔥\U0001F680'`.
Use backslash escape sequences within an escape string literal to represent special byte values:

| Backslash escape sequence             | Interpretation                                             |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `\b`                                  | backspace                                                  |
| `\f`                                  | form feed                                                  |
| `\n`                                  | newline                                                    |
| `\r`                                  | carriage return                                            |
| `\t`                                  | tab                                                        |
| `\o`, `\oo`, `\ooo` (o = 0–7)         | octal byte value (decimal value must be between 1 and 255) |
| `\xh`, `\xhh` (h = 0–9, A–F)          | hexadecimal byte value                                     |
| `\uxxxx`, `\Uxxxxxxxx` (x = 0–9, A–F) | 16 or 32-bit hexadecimal Unicode character value           |

Any other character following a backslash is taken literally (e.g., write two backslashes `\\` to include one backslash character).
The byte sequences you create must be valid UTF-8.
For historic reasons, if you set the setting `standard_conforming_strings` to `false`, regular string literals will also recognize backslash escape sequences.

## Binary

### BYTEA

Represents variable size binary data. A binary string is a sequence of bytes - unlike TEXT, there is no character set. The BYTEA data type is nullable. For more information, see [BYTEA data type](bytea-data-type.md).
