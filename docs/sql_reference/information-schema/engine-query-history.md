# Information schema for engine query history

You can use the `information_schema.engine_query_history` view to return information about queries saved to query history. The view is available in each database and contains two rows (start and finish) for each historical query in the database. The table is limited to contain the last 10'000 queries per engine cluster. You can use a `SELECT` query to return information about each query as shown in the example below.

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  information_schema.engine_query_history
LIMIT
  100;
```

## Columns in information_schema.engine_query_history

Each row has the following columns with information about each query in query history.

| Column Name            | Data Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
