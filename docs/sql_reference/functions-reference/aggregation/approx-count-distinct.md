# APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT

Counts the approximate number of unique values that are not NULL. 
Internally, `APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT` uses HyperLogLog (HLL) sketches.
Calling `APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT` returns the same value as calling `HLL_COUNT_DISTINCT` with precision 17.

## Syntax
{: .no_toc}

```sql
APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT(<expression>)
```

## Parameters
{: .no_toc}

| Parameter | Description  | Supported input types | 
| :--------- | :-----------|:----------|
| `<expression>`  | Expression on which to approximate the distinct count  | Any type | 

{: .note}
 

## Return Type
`BIGINT`

## Example
{: .no_toc}

When aggregating on few distinct values, `APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT` has no estimation error and returns exact results:

```sql
SELECT
    APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT(number) as approximate,
    COUNT(DISTINCT number) as exact
FROM
    generate_series(1, 1000) r(number);
```

**Returns**: 

| approximate | exact | 
|:----------------|:--------------|
| 1,000 | 1,000 | 


`NULL` values do not change the result of `APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT`:

```sql
SELECT
    APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT(number) as approximate,
    COUNT(DISTINCT number) as exact
FROM
    (SELECT * FROM generate_series(1, 1000)
       UNION ALL
     SELECT NULL) r(number);
```

**Returns**: 

| approximate | exact | 
|:----------------|:--------------|
| 1,000 | 1,000 | 

As the number of distinct values grows, the result becomes an approximation:

```sql
SELECT
    APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT(number) as approximate,
    COUNT(DISTINCT number) as exact
FROM
    generate_series(1, 50000) r(number);
```

**Returns**: 

| approximate | exact | 
|:----------------|:--------------|
| 50,160 | 50,000 | 

`APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT` also works for compound types:

```sql
SELECT 
    APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT(arr) as approximate,
    COUNT(DISTINCT arr) as exact
FROM 
    unnest([[1, 2], [3, 4], NULL, [NULL], [1, NULL]]) r(arr)
```

**Returns**: 

| approximate | exact | 
|:----------------|:--------------|
|4 | 4 |
