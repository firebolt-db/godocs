## Example
{: .no_toc}

In the example below, the `LAG `function is being used to find the players in each level who ranked above and below a certain player. In some cases, if the player has no one ranked above or below them, the `LAG `function returns `NULL`.

```sql
SELECT
	nickname,
	level,
	LAG(nickname, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY level ORDER BY nickname ) AS rank_above,
	LAG(first_name, -1) OVER (PARTITION BY level ORDER BY first_name ) AS rank below
FROM
	players;
```

**Returns**:

| nickname | level | rank_above | rank_below |
|:----------|:-------------|:-------------|:--------------|
| kennethpark      |           9 | NULL        | rileyjon     |
| rileyjon   |           9 | kennethpark       | sabrina21         |
| sabrina21       |           9 | rileyjon    | ymatthews         |
| ymatthews      |           9 | sabrina21       | NULL         |
