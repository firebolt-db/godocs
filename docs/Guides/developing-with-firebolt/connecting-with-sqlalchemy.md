# Connect with SQLAlchemy

SQLAlchemy is an open-source SQL toolkit and object-relational mapper for the Python programming language.

Fireboltâ€™s adapter for SQLAlchemy acts as an interface for other supported third-party applications including Superset and Preset. When the SQLAlchemy adapter is successfully connected, these applications are able to communicate with Firebolt databases through the REST API.

The adapter is written in Python using the SQLAlchemy toolkit.

### Get started

Follow the guidelines for SQLAlchemy integration in the Firebolt-SQLAlchemy [Github repository](https://github.com/firebolt-db/firebolt-sqlalchemy/).
