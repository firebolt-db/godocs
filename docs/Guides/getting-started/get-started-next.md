# Resources beyond getting started

Now that you have successfully created your first engine and database, run your first query, created indexes, copied data into Firebolt and exported data out, you can continue exploring Firebolt’s capabilities.

## Register through the AWS Marketplace

If you have exhausted your initial $200 credit, you can continue to use Firebolt after registering through the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace). You must set up an account for billing in order to continue using Firebolt’s engines to run queries.

**To register**

1. On the [Firebolt Workspace page](https://go.firebolt.io/), select the **Configure**(<img src="../../assets/images/configure-icon.png" alt="AggIndex" width="14"/>) icon from the left navigation pane. 
2. Under **Organization settings**, select **Billing**.
3. Click **Connect to AWS Marketplace** to take you to the Firebolt page on AWS Marketplace.
4. On the AWS Marketplace page, click the **View Purchase Options** in the top right hand corner of the screen.
5. Click **Setup Your Account**.

Your account should now be associated with AWS Marketplace.
