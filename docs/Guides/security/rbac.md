# Manage role-based access control
{: .no_toc}

Role-based access control provides the ability to control permissions and determine who can access and perform operations on specific objects in Firebolt. Permissions are assigned to roles which are, in turn, assigned to users or other roles. A user can be assigned multiple roles.

A user interacting with Firebolt must have the appropriate permissions to use an object. Permissions from all roles assigned to a user are considered in each interaction in Firebolt. 

To view all roles, click **Govern** to open the govern space, then choose **Roles** from the menu, or query the [information_schema.applicable_roles](../../sql_reference/information-schema/applicable-roles.md) view.

## System-defined roles

Roles are assigned to users to allow them to complete tasks on relevant objects to fulfill their business needs. Each account is provisioned with a set of system-defined roles.

| Role Name      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 
|:---------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| public         | Equivalent to `USAGE` on every database as well as `USAGE` and `CREATE` on every `public` schema.<br>This role is automatically granted to every new user, but can be revoked if desired. |
| system_admin   | Enables managing databases, engines, schemas, tables, and views. This includes setting database and engine properties as well as access to the observability functionality on all engines. |
| account_admin  | Enables all the permissions and the ability to manage the account. |

System-defined roles can neither be modified nor dropped. Users with the `account_admin` role can grant roles to other users.

## Custom roles

A user with the `account_admin` role can create custom roles. You can create a custom role using SQL, or via the UI.

Privileges can be granted to a custom role either by the `account_admin` or by the owner of a resource. For example, a user who created a table can grant `SELECT` on that table to an arbitrary custom role.

## Ownership

When a user creates an object, they become its owner. The owner of an object can perform any operation on the object, even if the privileges normally required to perform that operation aren't granted to any of the user's roles. See [Ownership](./ownership.md) for more information.

An owner of an object can also grant privileges over that object to any role. A role owner can grant that role to users and other roles without the requirement of being an admin.

## Permissions

A set of permissions can be granted to a custom role over the supported objects: account, database, engine, schema, table, or view. Available permissions for each object type are listed below. To view all current permissions, query the [information_schema.object_privileges](../../sql_reference/information-schema/object-privileges.md) view.

### Account

Permissions can be granted on accounts to allow creating, modifying and using databases and engines.

| Permission          | Description                                                                   |

Permissions can be granted on tables to allow operations on them.

| Permission         | Description |
| :---------------   | :---------- |
| DELETE             | Enables deleting rows and [dropping partitions](../../sql_reference/commands/data-definition/alter-table.md) from the table. Applicable only on managed tables. |

* the `USAGE` permission on the parent database.

#### Aggregating Index

In order to create an aggregating index, a user must have:

* the `MODIFY` permission on the table.
* the `CREATE` permission on the parent schema.
* the `USAGE` permission on the parent schema.
* the `USAGE` permission on the parent database.

Dropping an aggregating index requires:

* the `MODIFY` permission on the table.
* the `USAGE` permission on the parent schema.
* the `USAGE` permission on the parent database.

#### View

Permissions can be granted on views to allow usage and modification of views.

| :---------------   | :---------- |
| SELECT             | Enables using the view. |
| MODIFY             | Enables modifying the view. |

Performing operations on a view also requires:

* the `USAGE` permission on the parent schema.
* the `USAGE` permission on the parent database.

#### Owner rights

When selecting over a view, the user executing a query needs to have a `SELECT` privilege over the view. However, `SELECT` privileges over tables and views referenced in that view are enforced for the view owner rather than the user executing the query. For example:

```sql
CREATE USER user1 WITH ROLE=role1;
CREATE USER user2 WITH ROLE=role2;

CREATE TABLE t (a int); -- executed by user1
CREATE VIEW v AS SELECT * FROM t; -- executed by user1

GRANT SELECT ON VIEW v TO role2;
REVOKE SELECT ON TABLE t FROM role2;
SELECT * FROM v; -- executed by user2, successfully

REVOKE USAGE ON SCHEMA public FROM role1;
-- role1 no longer has no access to the table due to missing schema usage privileges
SELECT * FROM v; -- executed by user2 and fails because the view owner's role1 cannot access table t
```


## Create role

### SQL
To create a custom role using SQL, use the [`CREATE ROLE`](../../sql_reference/commands/access-control/create-role.md) statement. For example:

```sql
CREATE ROLE user_role;
```

### UI
To create a custom role via the UI:

![Govern > Roles](../../assets/images/rolespage.png)

1. Click **Govern** to open the govern space, then choose **Roles** from the menu.
2. From the Roles management page, choose **New role**. 
3. Enter a role name. 
4. Choose the object type you want to grant permissions on for the role from the left-hand list; databases or engines.
4. Choose the permissions you want to grant for each object type. You can use the toggles at the top to grant permissions over all databases or engines, or you can define permissions more granularly on existing databases or engines using the table views, where you can also search by database or engine name.

```sql
REVOKE ROLE user_role FROM USER alex;
```

### UI
To revoke a role from a user or another role via the UI, follow the [same steps above](#grant-role) that you would to grant a role.  


### Check assigned privileges using SQL

To show all effective privileges of the user running the query:

```sql
SELECT
  AR.grantee,
  AR.role_name,
  OP.privilege_type,
  OP.object_type,
  OP.object_name
FROM information_schema.transitive_applicable_roles AS AR
JOIN information_schema.object_privileges AS OP
ON (AR.role_name = OP.grantee)
WHERE
  AR.grantee = session_user();
```

**Returns**: 

| grantee   | role_name     | privilege_type | object_type | object_name |
|:----------|:--------------|:---------------|:------------|:------------|
| test_user | account_admin | USAGE | engine | engine1 | 
| test_user | account_admin | USAGE | database | db1 |
