# Release notes

Firebolt continuously releases updates so that you can benefit from the latest and most stable service. These updates might happen daily, but we aggregate release notes to cover a longer time period for easier reference. The most recent release notes from the latest version are below.

- See the [Release notes archive](../release-notes/release-notes-archive.md) for earlier-version release notes.
